**_Week 1 Overview_**...

I'm learning Python because it is a necessary component in regards to Machine Learing. 

I'm not very good at programming, but I understand (to a degree) what you can do with the skillset. 

To my knowledge, Python is one of the easier programming languages to learn. I've been off and on over the years, but this will help me stick with it and apply what I've learned along the way. 



**Goals for this week**:

Mainly just to set up the structured framework, so I can follow a learning style that can guide me along the way. 

Also want to get back into Python to analyze where I'm currently at; that way I can keep track the progress over time. 

Make space on devices so I can make time to record MML vlog. 

Not sure of any other goals for this particular week. Just want to get started and work on staying consistent, so I learn, apply, & scale up.


*Quick side note, I'm adding this because today's "assignment" was to create a new branch for Week 1 Sprint; add a markdown file; then jot down Why I'm Learning Python, and Goals for Week 1. 
In the process, I made a Week 1 Sprint branch, but felt like I "messed up" when it came to the markdown file. I seemed to have found a way to do it up the main MML branch, but I'm going to see if I can transfer it to the Week 1 overview branch in...
