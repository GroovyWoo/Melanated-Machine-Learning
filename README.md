# Melanated Machine Learning (MML)

Welcome to **Melanated Machine Learning (MML)** — my personal and professional journey into the world of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and beyond. This space serves as both a documentation hub and an invitation for others, especially Melanted indiviudals  (native Black/African American/Moorish/etc) to learn, explore, and thrive within the evolving tech landscape.

## About the Project

**MML** represents more than just machine learning. It stands for:

- **Melanated** — Honoring identity, representation, and rootedness.
- **Machine Learning** — Lifelong learning through both personal growth and technical exploration.

Just as a computer consists of hardware and software, I see the human body as the hardware and the mind as the software. As I continue to learn and evolve, I view it as the "machine learning" — both figuratively and literally.

Through this project, I aim to:

- Share my self-taught AI/ML journey and daily/weekly practices
- Build a growing hub/community for others in the space
- Highlight underrepresented voices and faces in tech (as well notable voices that people may not be aware of, but should) 
- Provide a learning trail that others can follow, build upon, and contribute to

## Repository Structure

- `daily-log.md` — Notes, wins, struggles, and reflections from each session
- `learning-paths/` — Structured documentation of challenges, courses, and certifications
- `projects/` — In-progress and completed side projects and experiments
- `resources.md` — Curated links to tutorials, references, and helpful tools
- `roadmap.md` — A high-level guide of upcoming milestones and focus areas

## Connect & Contribute

While this is a personal journey, it’s also an open invitation. If you’re also navigating the tech space—especially if you’ve ever felt unseen or unheard—I see you. Let’s build together.

Feel free to fork, follow, or simply say hey.

Keep learning & evolving.

Stay Positive, Stay Blessed, an Stay Hydrated Playa...
