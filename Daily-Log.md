### 🎵 Project Focus
**Project 2: Music Miner / Music Metadata Extractor**  
*(Based on concepts from Automate the Boring Stuff with Python)*

---
### 🧠 What I did
- Started **Project 2**, focused on extracting and cleaning **music-related metadata**.
- Activated my Python virtual environment: **`music_env`**.
- Typed out and walked through the code step-by-step to better understand the logic flow.
- Implemented a text-cleaning step using **`re.sub()`**, which removes bracketed values from strings.
  - Example logic: remove patterns like `[12]` from titles.
- Encountered and debugged an error related to HTML parsing.
  - Learned the distinction between **`html.parser`** and **`lxml`**.
- Successfully ran the script after adjusting the parser configuration.

---
### 🔍 Key Observations
- The `re.sub()` usage felt like a **“mini AI moment”**:
  - Instructing Python to *search for anything inside brackets and delete it*.
  - Pattern used:  
    ```python
    r'$begin:math:display$\.\*\?$end:math:display$'
    ```
- This mirrors real-world **music industry data hygiene**:
  - Titles like `"Blinding Lights [1]"` can trigger errors in distributors or royalty tracking systems.
  - The script effectively acts as an **Automated Data Quality Controller**.
- Regular Expressions (`re`) will require deeper familiarity, especially as data volume increases.

---
### 🧩 Concepts Introduced
- **Regular Expressions (Regex)**  
  - Pattern matching and text normalization.
- **HTML Parsing**
  - Understanding parser options (`html.parser` vs `lxml`) and when to use them.
- **Defensive Programming (Open Question)**
  - Began thinking about how to write code that anticipates errors, bad data, or unexpected inputs.

---
### 🤔 Reflections
- I’m still not a “fan” of programming.
- However, Python is clearly a **necessary and foundational skill** for becoming a stronger AI / ML Engineer.
- Seeing direct overlap between:
  - Programming  
  - Music business workflows  
  - Data quality and automation  
  reinforces *why* this effort matters.

---
### 🔮 Forward Notes
- Spend more time learning **Regular Expressions** in practical contexts.
- Revisit **Defensive Programming** patterns and how they apply to data pipelines.
- Continue shaping this project into a reusable personal system for music catalog management.

- Continue pairing structured coursework with **practical Python projects** (e.g., automation, scraping, data handling).  
- Apply these concepts directly within upcoming MML-related tools and personal systems.

---


## 📅 13 Jan 26

### 🧠 What I did
- Recently joined a **local tech / AI workforce program** focused on skill development (certificates) and career assistance.  
- Gained access to **Coursera** through the program, with several courses offered for free. I more so need career assistance vs the skills. 
- Noted that I had already completed **Google AI Essentials** prior to joining.  
- Reviewed the **Prompt Engineering** course option; based on my current experience and confirmation from the program assistant, it wasn’t a priority at this stage.  
- Considered starting **Google Data Analytics**, but opted instead for a **Python Crash Course** to run in parallel with *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* as I finish the remaining projects.  
- Started **Module 1: “Hello Python!”**, completing initial videos and reading material.

---
### 🔍 What I noticed
- While data analytics is important long-term, strengthening **Python fundamentals** right now feels like higher leverage.  
- The Python Crash Course aligns well with my current workflow: scripting, automation, web scraping, and early-stage data handling.  
- Having external validation that I don’t *need* Prompt Engineering coursework right now reinforced the value of self-assessment and intentional learning paths.

---
### 🧩 Why this matters
- Python continues to be the **throughline** across automation, data collection, ML, and AI workflows.  
- Running multiple learning tracks in parallel (projects + structured coursework) helps reinforce concepts from different angles.  
- This choice supports long-term goals around ML, data systems, and building practical tools rather than collecting certificates without application.

---
### 🔮 Forward connection
- Continue progressing through the Python Crash Course alongside *Automate the Boring Stuff* projects.  
- Revisit **Data Analytics** later once data collection pipelines (scraping, CSVs, structured storage) are more mature.  
- Leverage this program not just for credentials, but as a bridge toward applied projects and career alignment within AI/ML (and other current tech roles).

## 🎵🗃️ 30 Dec 25 — Task Automation for Music File Management

### 📌 What I Worked On
- Practiced another **Task Automation Script** in Python — this time focused on **music-related files**.
- Learned how to **create empty (fake) files in macOS Terminal** to simulate a real-world media library.
  -  *Plays “Touch” by Omarion* lol 🎶
- Instead of manually dropping files into folders to “get started,” I:
  - Created files programmatically (in VS Code)
  - Then wrote a script to automatically **move & organize them into target folders**
- This took *way longer than expected*, but it helped me deeply understand:
  - where files are stored upon creation
  - directory structure behavior
  - and how to rebuild/re-organize file systems intentionally

Originally planned to work on **Web Scraping (The Data Miner Project)** but chose to stay focused on automation because it:
- is directly relevant to my real workflow
- solves a real pain point for creatives
- is a skill I plan to use personally — and potentially as a service

> Best way to help others is to do it for yourself first.

File management is real — and if I can build tools that remove that friction?  
That’s both **impact + value.**

---

### 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced
- Python automation scripting  
- Working with the filesystem  
- Creating files via **macOS Terminal**
- Moving / organizing files programmatically  
- Thinking in workflows instead of isolated scripts  

---

### 🧩 Where This Shows Up in AI / ML / AI Engineering
This project is *deceptively powerful* — because these concepts are the backbone of real-world AI systems:

- **Data Pipelines**
  - Moving & organizing raw data into structured folders is exactly what ML preprocessing workflows do
  - Think: images → `/train`, `/validation`, `/test`

- **LLM & RAG pipelines**
  - Files = documents
  - Organizing them = dataset curation
  - Later, retrieval systems depend on good structure

- **Automation / Agent workflows**
  - AI agents must:
    - locate files
    - read metadata
    - move outputs
    - clean directories

- **MLOps**
  - Automation scripts → evolve into pipelines
  - Pipelines → evolve into repeatable deployment flows

You’re not “just moving files.”  
You’re learning **system design thinking.**

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- macOS Terminal
- VS Code
- Python `pathlib` / filesystem utilities  
- Discipline + patience 😅  

---

### 📈 Reflection / Lessons Learned
- What looks “simple” becomes deep when you do it right
- Real-world data is messy — automation reduces chaos
- File organization isn’t boring — it’s **infrastructure**
- Reps matter. Each script builds confidence.

---

### 🎯 Why This Matters (For Me & Others)
This work connects to:
- creative workflows (music, content, media)
- AI workflows (datasets, pipelines)
- real human problems (digital clutter & chaos)

And it reminded me:
> Skills that solve real problems become high-value tools — both for you and your community.

---

### 🔮 Next Steps / Future Ideas
- Start/Finish **Web Scraping — “The Data Miner” Project**
- Build:
  - Music Library Organizer v2  
  - Media-Aware classifier (maybe ML-powered later)
- Consider eventually:
  - turning this into a **template repo**
  - or a **small tool for creatives**

---

### 🥷🏽 State of Mind 🧘🏽‍♂️
Progress doesn’t always look loud.

Sometimes it’s slow, intentional, infrastructure-building.  
This month has reminded me:
> Move steady. Honor the season. Keep learning.


---

##  29 Dec 25 

- Continued working through the **Python Fundamentals** lesson — today’s focus was on:
  - **Collections**
  - **Data Types** 

### 📚 Key Areas Studied

#### 🧱 Lists
- Reviewed how lists work and how they store ordered collections of values.
- Lists reminded me a lot of the **JSON prompt structures** I’ve been building for LLMs / prompt engineering — especially when dealing with:
  - Multiple template variations  
  - Stored prompts  
  - Reusable content blocks  

That familiarity definitely helped reinforce list concepts.

#### 🗂 Dictionaries
- Continued learning about **dictionaries**, especially:
  - **Keys**
  - **Key–value pairs**
- Still need more hands-on practice here to make them second nature — but I’m starting to understand how powerful they are for:
  - Structured data
  - Fast lookup
  - Storing labeled information (e.g., configs, metadata, user data, etc.)

---
### 🧠 Reflection
Today reinforced how **core Python data structures** connect directly to AI, LLM work, and automation — especially lists and dictionaries. More practice will help cement the concepts and make them feel more intuitive over time.

---

## 25 Dec 25 

- Continued the **Python Fundamentals** lesson, focusing on:
  - **Variables**
  - **Data Types**
  - **Reserved Words**
  - **f-strings and t-strings**
  - Hands-on work in **Jupyter Notebook** and **Trinket**

- Learned about **Reserved Words** in Python — something I don’t recall encountering in earlier study rounds. Definitely helpful when naming variables and avoiding conflicts.

- Refreshed my understanding of **f-strings** — how formatting works and how they differ from (and relate to) other string formatting approaches.

- Reviewed the main **Python data types**, recognizing many from past practice sessions.

---

### 🛠 Project Work — *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*
- Built a **Task Automation Script** that:
  - Scans a folder
  - Detects files by extension
  - Automatically moves them into sub-folders  
    (e.g., `.jpg → Images`, `.csv → Data`, etc.)

- Learned and applied:
  - **pathlib** — for OS-independent file handling
  - **Automating file movement**
  - Used a **test folder** to safely practice moving `.csv`, `.txt`, and `.jpg` files into their proper locations

- This workflow is something I definitely want to adopt in real life — especially for:
  - Large media libraries (photos, videos, external drives)
  - Music files & catalog organization  
    (released / unreleased / drafts / collabs / sound design, etc.)

---

### 🔁 Recap & Key Concepts Reinforced
- **Logic Loops** — Using `while` conditions so models/processes continue until a goal is met  
- **Set Operations** — Fast data comparison (e.g., checking whether guessed data matches target data)  
- **Pathlib / OS** — Interacting with the *physical* world (files, drives, cloud storage)  
- **Dictionary Mapping** — Creating simple rule-based “brains” that categorize data automatically based on patterns  

---

Overall — building toward automation skills felt rewarding today. The impact of small scripts at scale really stood out.


---

## 24 Dec 25 

- Continued the **Python Fundamentals** lesson within the AI & Data Science Fundamentals program.
- Covered topics including:
  - Programming concepts
  - Fibonacci sequences
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Python REPL (Read–Eval–Print Loop)
  - PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal)

- It was interesting to revisit **Fibonacci**, since I was first introduced to it through trading/investing — and later recognized how deeply it appears in **nature and plant structures**. Now seeing it again in the context of **Python and programming** added a new perspective.

- Learned about the **embedded Python REPL**, as well as the **PEP process** for improving Python over time.

- A key reminder from today:
  > **“Comment while you code.”**  
  This will help document intent and meaning in my programs — especially for times when I need to step away and later return to the project(s).

- Also spent time navigating and experimenting inside **Jupyter Notebook**. I know this will become a core tool for me moving forward, especially as I continue building skills through more hands-on practice.

---

  - Statistical Analysis  
  - Advanced Python  
  - Machine Learning  
  - Natural Language Processing  
  - Neural Networks  
  - AI Agents & Agent Workflows  
  - And more topics across the AI field  

- The **curriculum outline looks strong and structured**, but I’m currently **not able to invest financially**, so I’ll continue making the most of the free material for now.


---

## 20 Dec 25

- Picked back up **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**
- Intention this time is to stay **more project-focused** — still reinforcing fundamentals, but building **small, useful programs alongside the learning process**
- First project completed: a **Logic Bridge / “secret-word guessing” game**
  - Realized it’s very similar to my existing **“You Guessed It”** project on GitHub — essentially the same core concept, but with a different iteration and structure
  - Debating whether to **add it as a separate project** or **merge both into an enhanced / advanced version**
- Even though I felt a bit rusty, it was still **great practice — another confidence and skill-building rep**


---

## 14 Dec 25

- Made a strategic decision to **pivot focus from Machine Learning Engineering toward AI Engineering**
- Realized that **ML Engineering requires a deeper technical ramp-up**, while **AI Engineering aligns more closely with my current strengths and near-term career goals**
- Not abandoning ML — just **sequencing the journey more realistically**
- Committed to **doubling down on Python**, since it is foundational to both AI and ML roles
- Acknowledged that this pivot initially felt like “slowing down,” but reframed it as a **level-up strategy that allows faster growth, confidence-building, and career momentum**
- Plan to return to heavier ML theory and model-building later, once I’ve secured stronger footing and experience in AI Engineering

---

## 9 Dec 25

- Continued working through the **Linear Regression** section of the Machine Learning Crash Course  
- Learned about **Loss** — including:
  - What loss represents  
  - How distance to the correct answer relates to loss  
  - Different **types of loss functions**  
  - How loss is calculated  
  - Beginning to distinguish **MAE, MSE, and RMSE**, and expect the differences to become clearer with practice  

- Completed the **Parameters Exercise**, adjusting **weight and bias sliders** to find the linear model that minimizes **MSE loss** on the dataset  

- Began learning **Gradient Descent**  
  - Watched an example that compared tuning weights and bias to minimizing distance when locating a coffee shop  
  - Key takeaway: **lowest loss = best model fit**  
  - Recognized how this relates to real-world tools (e.g., map routing/optimization; Google/Apple Maps)  
  - Considering building a **distance-prediction or routing-style project** (e.g., coffee shops, libraries, grocery stores) for portfolio purposes + deeper understanding  

- Learned about **convex loss surfaces and convergence**, and how gradient descent follows the slope to reach the global minimum

---

## 8 Dec 25

- Started **Machine Learning Crash Course (Google Developers)**  
- Began the **Linear Regression** section  
- Reviewed the car **fuel-efficiency example** and how linear regression models map input features to a target value  
- Learned the core regression equation:
  \[
  y = b + w_1x_1
  \]
  where:  
  - **y** = predicted value  
  - **b** = bias/intercept  
  - **w₁** = weight  
  - **x₁** = input feature  

- Noted that more sophisticated ML models typically use **multiple features** (multivariate regression), not just one input  
- Continuing to build foundational intuition before implementing code-based examples

# 📆 November 2025 — Recap & Reflection
*A month of slowdown, recalibration, and learning what resilience actually feels like.* 

November was one of the slower and more challenging months since starting this journey. Not becuase of failure, but becuase of friction, life, shifting priotires, and the quiet reality of being human while trying to build something extraordinary. 

After the first week or two, my momentum began to dip. Grateful for a few life events (Birthday🙏🏽 and Thanksgiving), even though a few technical issues made it harder to execute on planned work. The urgency to *"move faster"* collided with ehaustion, timing, and real-life responsibilites. Slowing down felt uncomfortable. However, there's a lesson in the slowdown: sometimes the pause is part of the progress, even if/when it doesn't *feel* like it. This month reinforced the importance of patience, pacing, and recognizing capacity limits. Growth does not always look like constant output.

---

## 🔑 Key Themes

### Slower Momentum
- Energy and focus fluctuated throughout the month, requiring adjustments to expectations and workload.

### Balancing Learning and Life
- Managing (and achieving) certifications, projects, content ideas, and personal responsibilities created a heavy cognitive load. Even with strong habits and internal disciline, some days required rest instead of pushing through. Honoring that was necessary. 

### Reflection and Reset
- November acted as a pause to reassess direction, workflow, and long-term sustainability.

- **Test Early**: Certification prep benefits from taking practice exams sooner, while knowledge is fresh.  
- **Patience & Rest**: Growth is compounding, but burnout slows everything. Balance small daily steps with recovery.  
- **Stepping Stones Matter**: AI/ML certifications may not be the ultimate goal, but they strengthen credibility and open doors while building toward ML Engineer/Scientist roles.  

### 🎯 Focus Going Forward (Fall 2025)  
- **Certification Goal**: Retake and pass **OCI AI Foundations Associate** practice exam, then take and pass final exam.  
- **Public Presence**: Finalize and publish **MML website** (even simplified, with room for iterations).  
- **Collective Impact**: Deliver a strong **Colorado Startup Week** presentation with the AI Collective.  
- **Projects & Practice**: Expand MML projects on GitHub (ML recommendations, small games, chatbot improvements).  
- **Content**: Plan and begin work on **MML Episode 3** and Build With Me walkthroughs, and other related projects.  

**Overall Reflection (Summer 2025):**  
This quarter was about **laying foundations, experimenting, and learning patience**. Certifications, projects, and content releases each came with hurdles, but progress continued despite setbacks. The journey is starting to show tangible outcomes (certificates, videos, projects), setting up **Fall 2025 as a season of execution and showcase**. The big picture is clear: build credibility, strengthen skills, and keep momentum toward the ultimate ML Engineer/Scientist path...

## 📌 August 2025 Recap & Reflections  

### ✅ Progress & Wins  
- Continued building consistency with **Oracle’s Race to Certification 2025 (AI Track)**.  
  - Completed the **OCI AI Foundations course** (covered AI, ML, DL, GenAI, OCI AI Services, and portfolio tools).  
  - Earned certificate of completion, which adds credibility toward resume/LinkedIn.  
- Explored project ideas inspired by Oracle examples — such as creating an ML project featuring **melanated films, TV shows, and books** (future project direction).  
- Experimented with building the **MML one-page website/landing page**. Learned about vibe coding, integrations, and embedding elements like logos/socials.  
- Completed **Google x Coursera AI Essentials specialization** (through trial period), adding another credential to showcase.  
- Created a **MML chat bot with Google AI Studio**, capturing the process with screenshots and screen recordings for future content (Build With Me series).  
- Released **MML Episode 2** on YouTube despite editing struggles — a major milestone in documenting the journey.  

### ⚠️ Challenges  
- **Website struggles**: Difficulty embedding MML logo and publishing due to coding/token limitations. Debating whether to simplify design or pivot tools (Bolt, Loveable, or alternatives).  
- **Gemini AI Nano Banana feature** testing resulted in repeated errors (likely a wider platform issue).  
- **Certification prep**: First attempt at Oracle OCI AI Foundations Associate practice exam ended in a fail. Main challenges: second-guessing answers, timing fatigue, and knowledge recall.  
- **Time & energy balance**: Still adjusting between AI Collective commitments, personal MML projects, certification study, transitioning into a higher paying job/role, and content creation. Burnout tendencies reappeared when trying to juggle everything at once.  

### 💡 Lessons Learned  
- **Execution > perfection**: Even with editing hiccups (CapCut watermark) and delays, publishing Episode 2 was more valuable than waiting for the “perfect” version.  
- **Test early, test often**: Practice exams are best taken earlier in the study cycle to identify gaps when the content is fresh.  
- **Pacing matters**: Marathon mindset > sprinting. Daily consistency, even in small steps, prevents burnout.  
- **Balance of tools**: Vibe coding tools save time, but sometimes manual coding may be more reliable. Need to decide when to automate vs. when to roll up sleeves.  

### 🎯 Focus for September  
- Retake **OCI AI Foundations Associate certification** with stronger prep (targeting a pass).  
- Finalize and **publish MML landing page** — even if simplified at first, then improve iteratively.  
- Prep for **Colorado Startup Week presentation** with the AI Collective (balance polish with storytelling).  
- Start early planning for **MML Episode 3** and potential Build With Me project walkthroughs.  
- Recommit to **consistent ML practice** (Python projects, Automate the Boring Stuff, Kaggle, etc.) alongside certification prep.  

**Overall:** August was a month of **persistence and patience**. Progress wasn’t always smooth, but milestones were still hit — certifications, (MML Vlog) Episode 2 release, and completion of major courses. The foundation is strengthening, even if momentum felt slower at times. September will be about converting that groundwork into **tangible wins** (certification pass, site launch, public showcase).

## 30 Aug 25  
- Took **Oracle’s OCI AI Foundations Associate Certification Practice Exam**. Failed 1st attempt.  
- Most incorrect answers came from situations where I “knew” the answer but second-guessed myself, or was stuck between two close options.  
- Out of 40 questions, about 4–5 I wasn’t sure about at all and just guessed.  
- Realized I should’ve taken the practice test sooner while the info was fresher in my mind.  
- Hour-long tests make me a bit wary, need to work on pacing and confidence under timed conditions.  

---

## 26 Aug 25  
- Might have to start over or forget about **Bolt** and use something else (maybe **Loveable**). Running into “too many” issues trying to complete a simple task. Debating whether to remove the **image in the Hero section** altogether and just publish.  
- Tried testing **Google/Gemini’s new Nano Banana feature**, but kept encountering errors. Tested with both random internet images and free/commercial-use image sites — same result. Noticed other forums reporting similar issues, so I’ll try again another time.  

---

## 23 Aug 25  
- Continued **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure AI Foundations Course** within OCI AI Foundations training/learning path.  
- Completed lessons on:  
  - OCI AI Portfolio  
  - OCI Generative AI Service  
  - OCI AI Services  
- In the Generative AI Service section, one example used a **Top 10 Streamed Movies** dataset with an APEX interactive report to fetch details. This sparked an idea to create a similar ML project/model focused on **Black (Melanated) films, TV shows, and books** (with music as a possible later extension).  
- **Completed the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) AI Foundations Course** ✅. The Skills Check quizzes after each lesson/module were helpful for reinforcing knowledge.

## 📆 July 2025 Recap & Reflection

### 🧠 Highlights & Accomplishments

- ✅ **Released MML Episode 2** on YouTube  
  - Focused on "How Did I Get Here?"—covering personal ML journey, foundational concepts of machine learning, and common model types (Supervised, Unsupervised, etc.).  
  - Editing proved time-consuming, especially using CapCut (watermark included), but the episode was finalized and shared across platforms.  

- ✅ **Published First Two Python Projects to GitHub**  
  - `Launchpad.py` (mini browser automation script): opened multiple MML-related websites with one command.  
  - `You Guessed It` (number guessing game): included project README, learning use of `random.randint`, loops, input validation, and project structure.  
  - Both added to the `projects/` folder in the MML repo with complete READMEs.

- 🧩 **Python Study & Learning Progress**  
  - Continued through *Automate The Boring Stuff With Python* (ATBS), finishing Chapters 2–4: Flow Control, Boolean Logic, If/Else/Elif, Loops, and Importing Modules.  
  - Exercises sparked creative project ideas (e.g., “She’s Too Young For You Bro” and "New Phone, Who Dis?")  
  - Developed stronger comfort in identifying and fixing errors/debugging (e.g., `random.radiant` typo = `randint`)

- 🏗️ **Project Planning & Roadmap Expansion**  
  - Finalized and committed project folders in MML GitHub repo  
  - Added README structure for each project; used a consistent format with sections for overview, setup, usage, license, etc.

---

### 🔍 Reflections & Lessons Learned

- **Done is better than perfect.** Episode 2 took longer than expected, but publishing it helped clear mental space and build momentum.
- **Python repetition is building intuition.** Loops, conditionals, and input/output are becoming second nature through both reading and application.
- **The GitHub repo is becoming a digital portfolio.** Each README, project folder, and structured log is helping showcase the journey with clarity.
- **Burnout is real.** Slowing down when needed and honoring rest is part of the mastery process. Time is currency — spend it with purpose.

---

### 📌 Focus Going Into August

- Finish 1–2 more Python projects (Unit Converter, Flashcard Quiz, or Bonus)
- Begin Build With Me: Supervised ML Bot (e.g. Book Recommender)
- Establish weekly rhythm: 3–5 study sessions + 1 content drop (YouTube, short, or GitHub)
- Explore first AI certification (Oracle, AWS, or Google) if financially viable
- Lighten backlog: CapCut editing, newsletter/email automations, content batching

## 📅 31 Jul 25

### 🎥 MML Episode 2 (YouTube Vlog)
- ✅ **Finally completed and published** MML Episode 2.
- 🎬 Kept CapCut watermark for time’s sake; will explore alternative editing tools/platforms in the future to avoid this issue.
- 🕒 Although the video was recorded and filmed in mid-June (with the goal of releasing before the end of June), editing delays pushed the release to late July.
- 😔 Felt slightly disheartened by the time it took to complete the edit — originally hoped to be on Episode 3 by now and showcasing Python/ML projects on the MML YouTube channel.
- 🙌 Despite the delays, **grateful to have finished and released** the episode.
- 📲 Shared the video on YouTube and across social media platforms. - https://youtu.be/tCznuJqSE1U 
- 🔁 Minor hiccup during upload due to video length (just over 15 minutes), but reupload was successful.

## 📅 30 Jul 25

### 🐍 Automate The Boring Stuff With Python (ATBS)
- 📺 **YouTube Lesson 5:** `if`, `elif`, and `else` Flow Control
- 🧱 Learned how **blocks** work in flow control:
  - If the condition is `True`, the code block executes and proceeds to "done".
  - If the condition is `False`, the code skips that block.
  - **Tip:** New blocks begin only after statements ending with a colon (`:`).
- 🧪 Went over multiple control flow examples:
  - `if` statement (e.g., name check)
  - `if/else` statement (e.g., password check)
  - `if/elif/else` statement (e.g., age example)
    - 💡 Reminder: Revisit "She’s Too Young for You, Bro" game idea.
- 💡 **Tip:** Multiple `if/elif/else` conditions can be used, but **order matters**.
- 💭 Explored use of **Truthy and Falsey values** with `input()`:
  - Created concept for an **interrogation-style game**, inspired by dialogue like:
    - `"Enter a name." → [9] → "I need a name." → [*silence*] → "I need a name." → [Jeff] → "Thank you for your cooperation."`
  - May need to explore **string validation** (e.g., distinguishing names from numbers) using `str.isalpha()` or regex. 


---


## 📅 28 Jul 25

- 🎬 Exported **MML Episode 2** video for final edits.
  - Final cut was edited using **CapCut**.
  - Discovered the **CapCut watermark/logo** was automatically included in the exported version.
  - Currently at a standstill while exploring **workarounds** to remove the watermark without compromising video quality.
  - Goal: Deliver a clean, professional final upload without branding conflicts.


---


## 📅 25 Jul 25

- 🛠️ Updated the **ML Mastery Roadmap** to include **Oracle’s Race to Certification** (AI track).
  - Goal: Use AI certification to support the **job/career search** while continuing to pursue higher-paying ML roles.
  
- 🧠 Have not completed much hands-on **coding**, **practice**, or **project work** in recent weeks.

- 🤝 Balancing multiple commitments:
  - Responsibilities within the **AI Collective/Agency** (tasks, meetings, planning)
  - Finishing and publishing **MML Episode 2**
  - Ongoing networking, meetings, and real-life responsibilities

- ⛔ Attempted to leave the AI Collective due to feeling overwhelmed and (personally) not progressing fast enough.
  - Collective encouraged continued participation:
    - "Keep shooting, this is the gym."
    - Emphasized the importance of showing up, even during slower periods.
  - Reflecting on the timing:
    - MML and the AI Collective started around the same time — a meaningful coincidence.

- ⚖️ Noticed effects of **spreading too thin**:
  - Feeling **impatient** due to slow learning/progress
  - Difficulty maintaining focus and consistency
  - Juggling passion projects, team roles, and survival simultaneously

- 🧘🏽‍♂️ Personal realization:
  - Struggle with slowing down after feeling “behind”
  - High sense of urgency can create **false productivity**
  - Difference between being **busy** and being **effective**
  - Relearning the **value of rest** and recognizing the **cost of burnout**


---


### 🗓️ 9 Jul 25

- 📘 **Automate The Boring Stuff With Python**  
  - Continued **Lesson 4 (YouTube)** / **Chapter 2 (ebook)** on *Flow Control*.

  - ✅ **Importing Modules**  
    - Learned about the **standard library** — built-in Python modules like `random`, `sys`, `os`, `math`.
    - Important tip: Avoid overwriting module names to prevent `AttributeError`.
    - Error encountered during `printRandom.py`:  
      - `AttributeError: module 'random' has no attribute 'radiant'`  
      - Realized `"radiant"` was a typo — should’ve been `"randint"`, smh 🤦🏽‍♂️  
      - Corrected and code ran fine afterwards.

  - ✅ **System Exit Exercise**  
    - Created program that included an infinite loop intended to break with `sys.exit()`  
    - While using **VS Code** (instead of IDLE), didn’t observe infinite loop behavior as expected. Message displayed `"type exit to exit"` followed by exit prompt.
    - Moving on for now, may revisit in the future.

  - ✅ **Guess the Number Game**  
    - User guesses a secret number between 1 and 20 within 6 attempts using `randint()`.
    - Displays number of guesses taken if successful.

  - ✅ **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**  
    - Used both `random` and `sys` modules.
    - Encountered formatting issue where part of the code was greyed out in VS Code. Took a break (nap), realized issue was with indentation, fixed it, and ran it successfully.
    - Won 3 times in a row — ended while I was on top, undefeated 💪🏽

<img width="385" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-09 at 6 47 02 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f6002e6-a6c2-4038-abf4-bd2f4fded216" />

  - 🧠 **Practice Questions**  
    - Completed chapter-end practice questions.
    - Some were challenging, but attempting each one strengthened understanding of concepts.

- 🕹️ **Project: You Guessed It**  
  - Built simple number guessing game and named it **You Guessed It** 🎯
  - Basic version for now — may expand later with difficulty levels or score tracking (v2 or deluxe version). 
  - Project added to `Projects` folder on GitHub so others can play and/or contribute. 

  
---


## 🗓️ 8 Jul 25

- 📘 **Automate The Boring Stuff With Python**  
  - Continued **Lesson 4 (YouTube)** / **Chapter 2 (ebook)** on *Flow Control*.
  - Practiced **Truthy and Falsey values**: created an input-based program where the user confirms name and guest count — resembles a reservation system (e.g., restaurant or hotel).
  - Explored `for` loops with the `range()` function:  
    - First message prints once, followed by second message five times — reminded me of a producer tag stutter effect.
    - Implemented **Young Gauss** summation technique with loop.
    - Completed additional `range()` function examples to reinforce understanding of counting patterns and repetition.
  - Noted strong overlap between these exercises and previous CodéDex challenges — reinforcing foundational learning.
  - 👀 Insight: Range functions will likely become more useful when manipulating data, especially for ascending/descending patterns.


---

## 🗓️ 6 Jul 25

- ✅ Added **Launchpad.py** as the first (mini) Python project to the `Projects` folder in the MML GitHub repo.
- 📁 Created a dedicated subfolder with a `README.md` documenting the project overview, usage, and additional context for future viewers or collaborators.
- ✍🏽 Reinforced GitHub repo structure (Projects folder + individual READMEs) to scale future project contributions.
- 🎉 Noted as the official **first Python project milestone** in the MML journey — marking a shift from practice to actual builds.

---

## 📅 5 Jul 25

### 🐍 Automate The Boring Stuff With Python (ATBS)
- **Lesson 4 (YouTube) / Chapter 2 (eBook):** Focused on *Flow Control*.
- Practiced comparison and Boolean operators (`True` & `False`) using MacOS Terminal.
- Reviewed flowchart examples for `if/else/elif` and `while` loops — reminded me of similar exercises from Codédex.
- Had an idea to turn the *“She’s Too Young For You Bro”* flow logic into a mini game — something to explore later.
- Completed *Infinite Loop* exercise; confirmed `ctrl + C` stops the loop with a `KeyboardInterrupt` message.
- Modified “Who Are You?” infinite loop into a playful version called *“New pHone, Who Dis?”*
  - Observed infinite loop behavior when incorrect input was entered.
  - Noted a bug: The “access granted” message appeared even when input was incorrect — logic bug in `if` statement at the end. True/False condition needs refinement.
  - Program ends as expected when correct input is finally given — something to revisit during debugging practice.

> 🎯 **Note:** Will continue building familiarity with input validation, control flow logic, and testing user interaction via CLI.

 **📚 CodéDex**

**Detention Exercise** (Loops Module):  
- Practiced using `for` loops and `range()` functions.  
- Completed the exercise in two attempts. Double-checked solution due to how quickly it was completed.
- One of the shortest exercises so far (besides `print("hello world")`).

**99 Bottles Exercise** (Loops Module):  
- Used `for` loop, `range()`, and string interpolation.  
- Compared to the backend of email newsletters — same body, different personalized fields (e.g. name).  
- Initial output was backwards (0 up to 99). Attempted `{1 - i}` which resulted in output from 0 to -98.  
- Realized the proper `range()` was `(99, 0, -1)`. Will research more on how the 0 and sequence order work.
- Originally wrote the entire hook/chorus on one `print()` line. While it worked, the line-by-line solution was clearer and cleaner.

**✅ Up Next** 

**Fizz Buzz** is the final exercise in the Loops module.

- Remaining CodéDex Python modules are behind a paywall (`Join Club`).
- Considering pivoting to:
  - CodéDex’s *User Tutorial Projects* (mostly Python-focused),
  - Another beginner Python program/platform outside of CodéDex,
  - CodéDex’s *NumPy* (Intermediate, free) or *SQL* (Beginner) courses.
  - Exploring *Challenge Packs* in the *Practice* tab (includes Python, HTML, JavaScript).

> Not planning to stop using CodéDex anytime soon — just expanding the toolkit and seeking more advanced or varied challenges.

.Continued AI Skills Fest, currently working on a module/challenge, that is apart of one of the AI modules provided by LinkedIn x Microsoft - AI for Organizational Leaders by Microsoft and LinkedIn ; Have been able to collect a few certificates to add on my page, on my LinkedIn profile.  
.Watched/rewatched ML videos to keep information fresh in mind. Mostly foundational info .
.2 courses left in module, then will take exam .
.Finished remaining courses, took exam, but failed (first attempt) .

22 Apr 25 

Finishing remaining part of Intro to GH (MSFT Learn) module. Upon getting to exercise, noticed it was the same exercise I already did upon GH tutorial (https://github.com/GroovyWoo/skills-intro-to-github-MML ) .
.However, I wasn’t able to complete this (the first time around) and found out why. There was an issue upon creating the first branch. Branch name wasn’t exactly the same, which was the reason for hold up in the process (reminder to self follow exact directions, and try not to add anything unless “outcome” is not affected. side note: I put 'my-first-branch-mml' instead of just 'my-first-branch' smh lol. Ended up deleting branch after pull request successfully merged and closed. Gives option to restore branch as well. 
	.After redoing the exercise, I learned/relearned about repositories, branches, commits and how to “officially” create pull requests, and merge a pull request from a branch (main and sub).

19 - 21 Apr 25 

Debating if I should continue to add to this particluar this Daily Log, or just create new md Daily Log upon each entry .

.Watched AI Isn't the Solution video by Teneika Askew. Breaking down difference between AI and Automation; Briefly broke down ML; Stream lining Workflow ;. 

.Reviewing GitHub tutorials & GitHub for Beginners (youtube playlist); Will need to familiarize myself with Licenses and GitIgnore files . 
.Currently doing Intro to GitHub via Microsoft Learn, not understanding pull requests same way as through youtube videos. Possible dated info that doesn't reflect on possible updated GitHub page. 
.Also learned how to create Discussions (via Intro to GitHub via Microsoft Learn Module), under a different repo; May need to create a 'Discussions' for this particular repo. Think that would help along the way. 

.Need to get back to the MSFT AI Skills Fest Challenges, but understanding GitHub along the way for future projects and documentation purposes will be benefical and essential ; In which a Branch was created for that particular part of the process/journey. 
.Still need to make a vlog for Youtube (and branding purposes). Maybe I'll create it before or after the Discussions feature is implemented.
