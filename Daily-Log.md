### Highlights:
- Officially enrolled in the **Verizon Skill Forward program** with a primary focus on **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning** (via edX).
- Created and launched the **Melanated Machine Learning YouTube Channel**; handle: `@MMLVision`. Plan to post vlogs, learning documentation, and children’s audiobook/visual content.
- Signed up for **Codédex** and completed the **first Python lesson**; earned a badge. Platform is gamified, similar to Codecademy, but with pixel graphics and a growing community.
- Began organizing inboxes with the new **MelanatedMachineLearning@gmail.com** account; set up email signature and labels.
- GitHub repo structure cleaned up; now includes main and Week 1 Sprint branches with appropriate `.md` files (e.g., `readme.md`, `daily-log.md`, `Week1_Overview.md`).
- Continued integrating **ChatGPT** as a daily assistant for learning structure, planning, and documentation across platforms.

### Codecademy Progress (Python / ML-related):
- **In Progress**:
  - Code Foundations Skill Path
  - Learn Python 2 Course
  - Intro to Machine Learning
  - Machine Learning: Perceptrons
  - Machine Learning: Introduction with Regression
  - Learn to Use ChatGPT
- **Completed**: N/A (for now)

### Notes:
- Planning to use **Codecademy + Codédex** side-by-side in Week 1 Python training.
- Future reflections and quizzing planned based on course completions.
- Added Codédex to the Week 1 learning framework (update pending below).

_**Pre-Sprint Setup & Refinement**_

•Finalized GitHub repo cleanup and corrected file placement across branches. 

•Successfully deleted: 

- An incorrectly placed Week1_Overview.md from the main branch. 	
- A non-markdown Week1_Overview file from the Week1_Sprint branch. 	
- Verified current structure:
	 - Main branch: README.md, daily-log.md
 	- Week1_Sprint branch: README.md, daily-log.md, Week1_Overview.md


•Integrated a tailored learning framework using ChatGPT to create a structured roadmap and sprint strategy for MML (Melanated Machine Learning). 

•Implemented an improved README.md with a clear intro to the mission and intent of the MML repo, which is now live on the repo homepage.

•Outlined and prepped the first vlog script for the MML YouTube channel, setting the foundation for storytelling, community-building, and visibility. 

•Side Note: The visual display of the updated README.md on the repo homepage is a motivating milestone.

.Continued AI Skills Fest, currently working on a module/challenge, that is apart of one of the AI modules provided by LinkedIn x Microsoft - AI for Organizational Leaders by Microsoft and LinkedIn ; Have been able to collect a few certificates to add on my page, on my LinkedIn profile.  
.Watched/rewatched ML videos to keep information fresh in mind. Mostly foundational info .
.2 courses left in module, then will take exam .
.Finished remaining courses, took exam, but failed (first attempt) .

Finishing remaining part of Intro to GH (MSFT Learn) module. Upon getting to exercise, noticed it was the same exercise I already did upon GH tutorial (https://github.com/GroovyWoo/skills-intro-to-github-MML ) .
.However, I wasn’t able to complete this (the first time around) and found out why. There was an issue upon creating the first branch. Branch name wasn’t exactly the same, which was the reason for hold up in the process (reminder to self follow exact directions, and try not to add anything unless “outcome” is not affected. side note: I put 'my-first-branch-mml' instead of just 'my-first-branch' smh lol. Ended up deleting branch after pull request successfully merged and closed. Gives option to restore branch as well. 
	.After redoing the exercise, I learned/relearned about repositories, branches, commits and how to “officially” create pull requests, and merge a pull request from a branch (main and sub).

Completed MSFT Learn (Introduction to GitHub) module 
Now Back to AI Skills Fest (MSFT)
I'm Learning. Melanated Machine Learning. 

(side note, I need to figure out to separate lines within sentences (or vice versa). Show's on my end, but appears as a whole paragraph. May need to display screenshot for time being.)

Debating if I should continue to add to this particluar this Daily Log, or just create new md Daily Log upon each entry .

.Watched AI Isn't the Solution video by Teneika Askew. Breaking down difference between AI and Automation; Briefly broke down ML; Stream lining Workflow ;. 

.Reviewing GitHub tutorials & GitHub for Beginners (youtube playlist); Will need to familiarize myself with Licenses and GitIgnore files . 
.Currently doing Intro to GitHub via Microsoft Learn, not understanding pull requests same way as through youtube videos. Possible dated info that doesn't reflect on possible updated GitHub page. 
.Also learned how to create Discussions (via Intro to GitHub via Microsoft Learn Module), under a different repo; May need to create a 'Discussions' for this particular repo. Think that would help along the way. 

.Need to get back to the MSFT AI Skills Fest Challenges, but understanding GitHub along the way for future projects and documentation purposes will be benefical and essential ; In which a Branch was created for that particular part of the process/journey. 
.Still need to make a vlog for Youtube (and branding purposes). Maybe I'll create it before or after the Discussions feature is implemented.
