Debating if I should continue to add to this particluar this Daily Log, or just create new md Daily Log upon each entry 
Watched AI Isn't the Solution video by Teneika Askew. Breaking down difference between AI and Automation; Briefly broke down ML; Stream lining Workflow ; 
Reviewing GitHub tutorials & GitHub for Beginners (youtube playlist); Will need to familiarize myself with Licenses and GitIgnore files 
Currently doing Intro to GitHub via Microsoft Learn, not understanding pull requests same way as through youtube videos. Possible dated info that doesn't reflect on possible updated GitHub page. 
Also learned how to create Discussions (via Intro to GitHub via Microsoft Learn Module), under a different repp; May need to create a 'Discussions' for this particular repo. Think that would help along the way. 
Need to get back to the MSFT AI Skills Fest Challenges, but understanding GitHub along the way for future projects and documentation purposes will be benefical and essential ; In which a Branch was created for that particular part of the process/journey. 
Still need to make a vlog for Youtube (and branding purposes). Maybe I'll create it before or after the Discussions feature is implemented.
