## üóìÔ∏è June Week 1 Recap 
**Range:** June 1 ‚Äì June 7, 2025

---
### ü§ù AI Collective Collaboration
- Met with individuals to build an **AI collective**.
- Focused on aligning efforts with the **Technology Adoption Lifecycle** to capitalize on the wave early.
- Meetings centered around **role definitions**, **team structure**, and **framework building**.

### üß† Python & ML Practice
- Less hands-on time with Python/ML this week due to collective formation activities.
- Intention to return to consistent practice and project work next week.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Workflow
- Finally used **Gamma** for presentation and visual storytelling ‚Äî wish I had been utilizing it sooner.
- Identified opportunity to **leverage AI tools** for:
  - Workflow optimization
  - Video editing (vlogs for sure)
  - Project and framework development

### üìå Key Focus Areas Moving Forward
- Begin developing **solo project ideas**.
- Utilize AI tools more effectively for **proficient workflows**.
- Streamline **video creation and editing** for content documentation.

### üåê MML Expansion
- Created and launched **social media pages** for *Melanated Machine Learning (MML)* ; @MMLVision .

## üìÖ 3 Jun 25


### üêç Cod√©Dex

- Completed **Fizz Buzz** exercise within the **Loops** module/chapter.
- üß† This was an interesting (and difficult) challenge. Wasn‚Äôt familiar with the exercise before, but now understand why it‚Äôs used in interviews.
- ‚úÖ Successfully printed numbers from 1‚Äì100, but struggled with `if/elif/else` structure.
  - `if` statement was initially written backwards and wasn‚Äôt indented inside the `for` loop, which caused issues.
- üèÖ Earned the **Halo badge** after completing the Loops Module/Chapter.
- üìå Noticed additional **Challenge Packs** in the Control Flow and Loops sections‚Äîwill attempt those next.


### üìò Reading Progress

- Finished **Chapter 5** of _Machine Learning for Dummies, IBM Limited Edition_.


---

## 1 Jun 25 

- Read chapter 4 of *Machine Learning for Dummies, IBM Limited Edition*: **Getting Started with Machine Learning**.
- Key concepts covered:
  - Understanding how ML can help.
  - Focusing on the business problem(s), along with 3 fundamentals:
    1. What is the business problem you‚Äôre trying to solve?
    2. What are the hidden data resources that you can take advantage of to better understand your opportunities and threats?
    3. How can you prepare to get your data in order?
  - Importance of collaboration (within roles).
  - Executing a pilot project.
  - Determining the best learning model (and which tools to select and use).

## 31 May 25 

 **üìö Cod√©Dex**

**Detention Exercise** (Loops Module):  
- Practiced using `for` loops and `range()` functions.  
- Completed the exercise in two attempts. Double-checked solution due to how quickly it was completed.
- One of the shortest exercises so far (besides `print("hello world")`).

**99 Bottles Exercise** (Loops Module):  
- Used `for` loop, `range()`, and string interpolation.  
- Compared to the backend of email newsletters ‚Äî same body, different personalized fields (e.g. name).  
- Initial output was backwards (0 up to 99). Attempted `{1 - i}` which resulted in output from 0 to -98.  
- Realized the proper `range()` was `(99, 0, -1)`. Will research more on how the 0 and sequence order work.
- Originally wrote the entire hook/chorus on one `print()` line. While it worked, the line-by-line solution was clearer and cleaner.

**‚úÖ Up Next** 

**Fizz Buzz** is the final exercise in the Loops module.

- Remaining Cod√©Dex Python modules are behind a paywall (`Join Club`).
- Considering pivoting to:
  - Cod√©Dex‚Äôs *User Tutorial Projects* (mostly Python-focused),
  - Another beginner Python program/platform outside of Cod√©Dex,
  - Cod√©Dex‚Äôs *NumPy* (Intermediate, free) or *SQL* (Beginner) courses.
  - Exploring *Challenge Packs* in the *Practice* tab (includes Python, HTML, JavaScript).

> Not planning to stop using Cod√©Dex anytime soon ‚Äî just expanding the toolkit and seeking more advanced or varied challenges.

  - Some challenges were integrated with **LinkedIn Learning** modules that offer certificates, which can be added to a LinkedIn profile and potentially a resume.

**Cod√©dex Progress**
- Revisited the **Magic 8 Ball** exercise:
  - Realized I had initially overlooked the provided answer mappings in the instructions.
  - The use of `if/elif/else` statements now makes more sense, as they directly correspond to the random number range (1‚Äì9).
- Reviewed the **Cyclone** exercise, which introduces the use of **logical operators** in control flow.



---

## 22 May 25

**Cod√©dex Progress**
- Completed the **Magic 8 Ball** exercise in the **Control Flow** chapter/module.
  - Utilized the `random` number function to simulate the randomness of a Magic 8 Ball (numbers 1‚Äì9).
    - Rolled a **7** on first run, **2** on second, and **5** on third.
    - The randomness reminded me of a dice game or chance-based system.
- Developed a **Q&A** interaction for the exercise (coining it "Q&8" for Magic 8 Ball), where a question prompts a randomized response.
  - Needed some assistance with the `if/elif/else` logic structure to map numbers to appropriate Magic 8 Ball-style answers. 



---

## 20 May 25 

**Cod√©dex Progress**
- Continued working through the **Control Flow** chapter/module:

  - **pH Levels** exercise: used relational operators with `if/elif/else` statements to interpret acidity levels.
- Pet in Cod√©dex died due to inactivity after a few days. Restarted the **#30NitesOfCode** challenge to build consistency and momentum.

**Codecademy Progress**
- Continued the **Machine Learning: Perceptrons** module.
  - Got about halfway through the first task.
  - Beginning to understand foundational ML model behavior and logic through visual and code-based examples.

 23, 25 - 28 Apr 25 

.Continued AI Skills Fest, currently working on a module/challenge, that is apart of one of the AI modules provided by LinkedIn x Microsoft - AI for Organizational Leaders by Microsoft and LinkedIn ; Have been able to collect a few certificates to add on my page, on my LinkedIn profile.  
.Watched/rewatched ML videos to keep information fresh in mind. Mostly foundational info .
.2 courses left in module, then will take exam .
.Finished remaining courses, took exam, but failed (first attempt) . 


## 

22 Apr 25 

Finishing remaining part of Intro to GH (MSFT Learn) module. Upon getting to exercise, noticed it was the same exercise I already did upon GH tutorial (https://github.com/GroovyWoo/skills-intro-to-github-MML ) .
.However, I wasn‚Äôt able to complete this (the first time around) and found out why. There was an issue upon creating the first branch. Branch name wasn‚Äôt exactly the same, which was the reason for hold up in the process (reminder to self follow exact directions, and try not to add anything unless ‚Äúoutcome‚Äù is not affected. side note: I put 'my-first-branch-mml' instead of just 'my-first-branch' smh lol. Ended up deleting branch after pull request successfully merged and closed. Gives option to restore branch as well. 
	.After redoing the exercise, I learned/relearned about repositories, branches, commits and how to ‚Äúofficially‚Äù create pull requests, and merge a pull request from a branch (main and sub).

Completed MSFT Learn (Introduction to GitHub) module 
Now Back to AI Skills Fest (MSFT)
I'm Learning. Melanated Machine Learning. 

(side note, I need to figure out to separate lines within sentences (or vice versa). Show's on my end, but appears as a whole paragraph. May need to display screenshot for time being.)

19 - 21 Apr 25 

Debating if I should continue to add to this particluar this Daily Log, or just create new md Daily Log upon each entry .

.Watched AI Isn't the Solution video by Teneika Askew. Breaking down difference between AI and Automation; Briefly broke down ML; Stream lining Workflow ;. 

.Reviewing GitHub tutorials & GitHub for Beginners (youtube playlist); Will need to familiarize myself with Licenses and GitIgnore files . 
.Currently doing Intro to GitHub via Microsoft Learn, not understanding pull requests same way as through youtube videos. Possible dated info that doesn't reflect on possible updated GitHub page. 
.Also learned how to create Discussions (via Intro to GitHub via Microsoft Learn Module), under a different repo; May need to create a 'Discussions' for this particular repo. Think that would help along the way. 

.Need to get back to the MSFT AI Skills Fest Challenges, but understanding GitHub along the way for future projects and documentation purposes will be benefical and essential ; In which a Branch was created for that particular part of the process/journey. 
.Still need to make a vlog for Youtube (and branding purposes). Maybe I'll create it before or after the Discussions feature is implemented.
