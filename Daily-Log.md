Debating if I should continue to add to this particluar this Daily Log, or just create new md Daily Log upon each entry 
Watched AI Isn't the Solution video by Teneika Askew. Breaking down difference between AI and Automation; Briefly broke down ML; Stream lining Workflow ; 
Reviewing GitHub tutorials & GitHub for Beginners (youtube playlist); Will need to familiarize myself with Licenses and GitIgnore files 
Currently doing Intro to GitHub via Microsoft Learn, not understanding pull requests same way as through youtube videos. Possible dated info that doesn't reflect on possible updated GitHub page. 
Also learned how to create Discussions (via Intro to GitHub via Microsoft Learn Module), under a different repo; May need to create a 'Discussions' for this particular repo. Think that would help along the way. 
Need to get back to the MSFT AI Skills Fest Challenges, but understanding GitHub along the way for future projects and documentation purposes will be benefical and essential ; In which a Branch was created for that particular part of the process/journey. 
Still need to make a vlog for Youtube (and branding purposes). Maybe I'll create it before or after the Discussions feature is implemented.

Finishing remaining part of Intro to GH (MSFT Learn) module. Upon getting to exercise, noticed it was the same exercise I already did upon GH tutorial (https://github.com/GroovyWoo/skills-intro-to-github-MML ) .
However, I wasn’t able to complete this (the first time around) and found out why. There was an issue upon creating the first branch. Branch name wasn’t exactly the same, which was the reason for hold up in the process (reminder to self follow exact directions, and try not to add anything unless “outcome” is not affected. side note: I put 'my-first-branch-mml' instead of just 'my-first-branch' smh lol. Ended up deleting branch after pull request successfully merged and closed. Gives option to restore branch as well. 
	After redoing the exercise, I learned/relearned about repositories, branches, commits and how to “officially” create pull requests, and merge a pull request from a branch (main and sub).

Completed MSFT Learn (Introduction to GitHub) module 
Now Back to AI Skills Fest (MSFT)
I'm Learning. Melanated Machine Learning. 

(side note, I need to figure out to separate lines within sentences (or vice versa). Show's on my end, but appears as a whole paragraph. May need to display screenshot for time being.)
