## 🌞 Summer 2025 Recap & Reflections (June – August)  

### ✅ Key Progress & Milestones  
- **Content Creation & Branding**  
  - Launched and released **MML Episode 2** on YouTube (despite editing/watermark challenges), proving consistency and persistence in documenting the ML journey.  
  - Continued progress on the **MML one-page website/landing page**, experimenting with vibe coding, integrations, and logo/social embedding.  

- **Learning & Certifications**  
  - Completed **Google AI Essentials specialization (Coursera)** — added certificate for resume/LinkedIn credibility.  
  - Enrolled in and completed the **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure AI Foundations course** (part of Race to Certification 2025 program). Built a solid base in AI, ML, DL, Generative AI, and OCI AI services.  
  - Explored **Google AI Studio** by building a MML chatbot prototype, capturing process for future Build With Me content.  
  - Continued with **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**, progressing through flow control, loops, and input validation (early Python project ideas formed along the way).  

- **Community & Opportunities**  
  - Maintained active role in the **AI Collective**, helping prep for **Colorado Startup Week (Sept)** presentation.  
  - Balanced project building, certification study, and content creation while staying engaged with team collaboration.  

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced  
- **Editing & Publishing**: Episode 2 took longer than expected to finish due to editing/time management — reminder that done is better than perfect.  
- **Website struggles**: Integration issues (logo, Hero section, publishing delays) caused frustration, highlighting the need for both patience and better tooling.  
- **Certification hurdles**: First attempt at the Oracle practice exam ended in a fail, largely due to second-guessing and timing fatigue. Reinforced need for earlier test prep.  
- **Balance & Burnout**: Managing personal MML projects, Collective commitments, financial hardships, and certifications simultaneously led to spreading thin at times.  

### 💡 Lessons Learned  
- **Execution > Perfection**: Publishing imperfect work still creates progress and momentum.  
- **Iterative Building**: Projects (like the landing page) don’t have to be final on day one — launch, then refine.  
- **Test Early**: Certification prep benefits from taking practice exams sooner, while knowledge is fresh.  
- **Patience & Rest**: Growth is compounding, but burnout slows everything. Balance small daily steps with recovery.  
- **Stepping Stones Matter**: AI/ML certifications may not be the ultimate goal, but they strengthen credibility and open doors while building toward ML Engineer/Scientist roles.  

### 🎯 Focus Going Forward (Fall 2025)  
- **Certification Goal**: Retake and pass **OCI AI Foundations Associate** practice exam, then take and pass final exam.  
- **Public Presence**: Finalize and publish **MML website** (even simplified, with room for iterations).  
- **Collective Impact**: Deliver a strong **Colorado Startup Week** presentation with the AI Collective.  
- **Projects & Practice**: Expand MML projects on GitHub (ML recommendations, small games, chatbot improvements).  
- **Content**: Plan and begin work on **MML Episode 3** and Build With Me walkthroughs, and other related projects.  

**Overall Reflection (Summer 2025):**  
This quarter was about **laying foundations, experimenting, and learning patience**. Certifications, projects, and content releases each came with hurdles, but progress continued despite setbacks. The journey is starting to show tangible outcomes (certificates, videos, projects), setting up **Fall 2025 as a season of execution and showcase**. The big picture is clear: build credibility, strengthen skills, and keep momentum toward the ultimate ML Engineer/Scientist path...

## 📌 August 2025 Recap & Reflections  

### ✅ Progress & Wins  
- Continued building consistency with **Oracle’s Race to Certification 2025 (AI Track)**.  
  - Completed the **OCI AI Foundations course** (covered AI, ML, DL, GenAI, OCI AI Services, and portfolio tools).  
  - Earned certificate of completion, which adds credibility toward resume/LinkedIn.  
- Explored project ideas inspired by Oracle examples — such as creating an ML project featuring **melanated films, TV shows, and books** (future project direction).  
- Experimented with building the **MML one-page website/landing page**. Learned about vibe coding, integrations, and embedding elements like logos/socials.  
- Completed **Google x Coursera AI Essentials specialization** (through trial period), adding another credential to showcase.  
- Created a **MML chat bot with Google AI Studio**, capturing the process with screenshots and screen recordings for future content (Build With Me series).  
- Released **MML Episode 2** on YouTube despite editing struggles — a major milestone in documenting the journey.  

### ⚠️ Challenges  
- **Website struggles**: Difficulty embedding MML logo and publishing due to coding/token limitations. Debating whether to simplify design or pivot tools (Bolt, Loveable, or alternatives).  
- **Gemini AI Nano Banana feature** testing resulted in repeated errors (likely a wider platform issue).  
- **Certification prep**: First attempt at Oracle OCI AI Foundations Associate practice exam ended in a fail. Main challenges: second-guessing answers, timing fatigue, and knowledge recall.  
- **Time & energy balance**: Still adjusting between AI Collective commitments, personal MML projects, certification study, transitioning into a higher paying job/role, and content creation. Burnout tendencies reappeared when trying to juggle everything at once.  

### 💡 Lessons Learned  
- **Execution > perfection**: Even with editing hiccups (CapCut watermark) and delays, publishing Episode 2 was more valuable than waiting for the “perfect” version.  
- **Test early, test often**: Practice exams are best taken earlier in the study cycle to identify gaps when the content is fresh.  
- **Pacing matters**: Marathon mindset > sprinting. Daily consistency, even in small steps, prevents burnout.  
- **Balance of tools**: Vibe coding tools save time, but sometimes manual coding may be more reliable. Need to decide when to automate vs. when to roll up sleeves.  

### 🎯 Focus for September  
- Retake **OCI AI Foundations Associate certification** with stronger prep (targeting a pass).  
- Finalize and **publish MML landing page** — even if simplified at first, then improve iteratively.  
- Prep for **Colorado Startup Week presentation** with the AI Collective (balance polish with storytelling).  
- Start early planning for **MML Episode 3** and potential Build With Me project walkthroughs.  
- Recommit to **consistent ML practice** (Python projects, Automate the Boring Stuff, Kaggle, etc.) alongside certification prep.  

**Overall:** August was a month of **persistence and patience**. Progress wasn’t always smooth, but milestones were still hit — certifications, (MML Vlog) Episode 2 release, and completion of major courses. The foundation is strengthening, even if momentum felt slower at times. September will be about converting that groundwork into **tangible wins** (certification pass, site launch, public showcase).

## 30 Aug 25  
- Took **Oracle’s OCI AI Foundations Associate Certification Practice Exam**. Failed 1st attempt.  
- Most incorrect answers came from situations where I “knew” the answer but second-guessed myself, or was stuck between two close options.  
- Out of 40 questions, about 4–5 I wasn’t sure about at all and just guessed.  
- Realized I should’ve taken the practice test sooner while the info was fresher in my mind.  
- Hour-long tests make me a bit wary, need to work on pacing and confidence under timed conditions.  

---

## 26 Aug 25  
- Might have to start over or forget about **Bolt** and use something else (maybe **Loveable**). Running into “too many” issues trying to complete a simple task. Debating whether to remove the **image in the Hero section** altogether and just publish.  
- Tried testing **Google/Gemini’s new Nano Banana feature**, but kept encountering errors. Tested with both random internet images and free/commercial-use image sites — same result. Noticed other forums reporting similar issues, so I’ll try again another time.  

---

## 23 Aug 25  
- Continued **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure AI Foundations Course** within OCI AI Foundations training/learning path.  
- Completed lessons on:  
  - OCI AI Portfolio  
  - OCI Generative AI Service  
  - OCI AI Services  
- In the Generative AI Service section, one example used a **Top 10 Streamed Movies** dataset with an APEX interactive report to fetch details. This sparked an idea to create a similar ML project/model focused on **Black (Melanated) films, TV shows, and books** (with music as a possible later extension).  
- **Completed the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) AI Foundations Course** ✅. The Skills Check quizzes after each lesson/module were helpful for reinforcing knowledge.  

---

## 21 Aug 25  
- Continued **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure AI Foundations Course** within the **OCI AI Foundations training/learning path**.  
  - Completed lessons:  
    - *Deep Learning Foundations*  
    - *Generative AI and LLM Foundations*  
  - Now halfway through Course 1 (of 5) in the Learning Path.  

- Still unable to integrate **MML Logo** into the one-page website/landing page.  
  - Attempted updates + saves, but failed (likely due to token issue).  
  - Planning to take the **manual coding approach** next time.  
  - Page is otherwise ready to launch — just need the logo fix.  

- Reflection: *Vibe coding is killing the vibe… pun intended 😅*.  

---

## 20 Aug 25  
- Signed up and registered for Oracle’s **Race to Certification 2025** program via Oracle University.

  - Will focus on **AI**, as certification will support career/job growth while continuing to work toward ML Engineer/Specialist goals.  
  - Began **OCI AI Foundations Training** (Learning Path). Completed first two lessons:  
    - *AI Foundations*  
    - *Machine Learning Foundations*  

- Prepping for **Colorado Startup Week (mid-Sept)** with AI Collective/Team. Finalizing info + media for promo run.  

- Reminder to stay **focused and balanced**. Need to pace work/study and take breaks to avoid burnout (again 😒).   

---

## 19 Aug 25  
- Tried to finish updating MML landing page.  
- Ran out of daily tokens while attempting to integrate the MML logo into the page.  
- Thought it might have helped to code more efficiently and manually embed the logo into the code (something to revisit later).

---

### 🔍 Reflections & Lessons Learned

- **Done is better than perfect.** Episode 2 took longer than expected, but publishing it helped clear mental space and build momentum.
- **Python repetition is building intuition.** Loops, conditionals, and input/output are becoming second nature through both reading and application.
- **The GitHub repo is becoming a digital portfolio.** Each README, project folder, and structured log is helping showcase the journey with clarity.
- **Burnout is real.** Slowing down when needed and honoring rest is part of the mastery process. Time is currency — spend it with purpose.

---

### 📌 Focus Going Into August

- Finish 1–2 more Python projects (Unit Converter, Flashcard Quiz, or Bonus)
- Begin Build With Me: Supervised ML Bot (e.g. Book Recommender)
- Establish weekly rhythm: 3–5 study sessions + 1 content drop (YouTube, short, or GitHub)
- Explore first AI certification (Oracle, AWS, or Google) if financially viable
- Lighten backlog: CapCut editing, newsletter/email automations, content batching

## 📅 31 Jul 25

### 🎥 MML Episode 2 (YouTube Vlog)
- ✅ **Finally completed and published** MML Episode 2.
- 🎬 Kept CapCut watermark for time’s sake; will explore alternative editing tools/platforms in the future to avoid this issue.
- 🕒 Although the video was recorded and filmed in mid-June (with the goal of releasing before the end of June), editing delays pushed the release to late July.
- 😔 Felt slightly disheartened by the time it took to complete the edit — originally hoped to be on Episode 3 by now and showcasing Python/ML projects on the MML YouTube channel.
- 🙌 Despite the delays, **grateful to have finished and released** the episode.
- 📲 Shared the video on YouTube and across social media platforms. - https://youtu.be/tCznuJqSE1U 
- 🔁 Minor hiccup during upload due to video length (just over 15 minutes), but reupload was successful.

## 📅 30 Jul 25

### 🐍 Automate The Boring Stuff With Python (ATBS)
- 📺 **YouTube Lesson 5:** `if`, `elif`, and `else` Flow Control
- 🧱 Learned how **blocks** work in flow control:
  - If the condition is `True`, the code block executes and proceeds to "done".
  - If the condition is `False`, the code skips that block.
  - **Tip:** New blocks begin only after statements ending with a colon (`:`).
- 🧪 Went over multiple control flow examples:
  - `if` statement (e.g., name check)
  - `if/else` statement (e.g., password check)
  - `if/elif/else` statement (e.g., age example)
    - 💡 Reminder: Revisit "She’s Too Young for You, Bro" game idea.
- 💡 **Tip:** Multiple `if/elif/else` conditions can be used, but **order matters**.
- 💭 Explored use of **Truthy and Falsey values** with `input()`:
  - Created concept for an **interrogation-style game**, inspired by dialogue like:
    - `"Enter a name." → [9] → "I need a name." → [*silence*] → "I need a name." → [Jeff] → "Thank you for your cooperation."`
  - May need to explore **string validation** (e.g., distinguishing names from numbers) using `str.isalpha()` or regex. 


---


## 📅 28 Jul 25

- 🎬 Exported **MML Episode 2** video for final edits.
  - Final cut was edited using **CapCut**.
  - Discovered the **CapCut watermark/logo** was automatically included in the exported version.
  - Currently at a standstill while exploring **workarounds** to remove the watermark without compromising video quality.
  - Goal: Deliver a clean, professional final upload without branding conflicts.


---


## 📅 25 Jul 25

- 🛠️ Updated the **ML Mastery Roadmap** to include **Oracle’s Race to Certification** (AI track).
  - Goal: Use AI certification to support the **job/career search** while continuing to pursue higher-paying ML roles.
  
- 🧠 Have not completed much hands-on **coding**, **practice**, or **project work** in recent weeks.

- 🤝 Balancing multiple commitments:
  - Responsibilities within the **AI Collective/Agency** (tasks, meetings, planning)
  - Finishing and publishing **MML Episode 2**
  - Ongoing networking, meetings, and real-life responsibilities

- ⛔ Attempted to leave the AI Collective due to feeling overwhelmed and (personally) not progressing fast enough.
  - Collective encouraged continued participation:
    - "Keep shooting, this is the gym."
    - Emphasized the importance of showing up, even during slower periods.
  - Reflecting on the timing:
    - MML and the AI Collective started around the same time — a meaningful coincidence.

- ⚖️ Noticed effects of **spreading too thin**:
  - Feeling **impatient** due to slow learning/progress
  - Difficulty maintaining focus and consistency
  - Juggling passion projects, team roles, and survival simultaneously

- 🧘🏽‍♂️ Personal realization:
  - Struggle with slowing down after feeling “behind”
  - High sense of urgency can create **false productivity**
  - Difference between being **busy** and being **effective**
  - Relearning the **value of rest** and recognizing the **cost of burnout**


---


### 🗓️ 9 Jul 25

- 📘 **Automate The Boring Stuff With Python**  
  - Continued **Lesson 4 (YouTube)** / **Chapter 2 (ebook)** on *Flow Control*.

  - ✅ **Importing Modules**  
    - Learned about the **standard library** — built-in Python modules like `random`, `sys`, `os`, `math`.
    - Important tip: Avoid overwriting module names to prevent `AttributeError`.
    - Error encountered during `printRandom.py`:  
      - `AttributeError: module 'random' has no attribute 'radiant'`  
      - Realized `"radiant"` was a typo — should’ve been `"randint"`, smh 🤦🏽‍♂️  
      - Corrected and code ran fine afterwards.

  - ✅ **System Exit Exercise**  
    - Created program that included an infinite loop intended to break with `sys.exit()`  
    - While using **VS Code** (instead of IDLE), didn’t observe infinite loop behavior as expected. Message displayed `"type exit to exit"` followed by exit prompt.
    - Moving on for now, may revisit in the future.

  - ✅ **Guess the Number Game**  
    - User guesses a secret number between 1 and 20 within 6 attempts using `randint()`.
    - Displays number of guesses taken if successful.

  - ✅ **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**  
    - Used both `random` and `sys` modules.
    - Encountered formatting issue where part of the code was greyed out in VS Code. Took a break (nap), realized issue was with indentation, fixed it, and ran it successfully.
    - Won 3 times in a row — ended while I was on top, undefeated 💪🏽

<img width="385" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-09 at 6 47 02 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f6002e6-a6c2-4038-abf4-bd2f4fded216" />

  - 🧠 **Practice Questions**  
    - Completed chapter-end practice questions.
    - Some were challenging, but attempting each one strengthened understanding of concepts.

- 🕹️ **Project: You Guessed It**  
  - Built simple number guessing game and named it **You Guessed It** 🎯
  - Basic version for now — may expand later with difficulty levels or score tracking (v2 or deluxe version). 
  - Project added to `Projects` folder on GitHub so others can play and/or contribute. 

  
---


## 🗓️ 8 Jul 25

- 📘 **Automate The Boring Stuff With Python**  
  - Continued **Lesson 4 (YouTube)** / **Chapter 2 (ebook)** on *Flow Control*.
  - Practiced **Truthy and Falsey values**: created an input-based program where the user confirms name and guest count — resembles a reservation system (e.g., restaurant or hotel).
  - Explored `for` loops with the `range()` function:  
    - First message prints once, followed by second message five times — reminded me of a producer tag stutter effect.
    - Implemented **Young Gauss** summation technique with loop.
    - Completed additional `range()` function examples to reinforce understanding of counting patterns and repetition.
  - Noted strong overlap between these exercises and previous CodéDex challenges — reinforcing foundational learning.
  - 👀 Insight: Range functions will likely become more useful when manipulating data, especially for ascending/descending patterns.


---

## 🗓️ 6 Jul 25

- ✅ Added **Launchpad.py** as the first (mini) Python project to the `Projects` folder in the MML GitHub repo.
- 📁 Created a dedicated subfolder with a `README.md` documenting the project overview, usage, and additional context for future viewers or collaborators.
- ✍🏽 Reinforced GitHub repo structure (Projects folder + individual READMEs) to scale future project contributions.
- 🎉 Noted as the official **first Python project milestone** in the MML journey — marking a shift from practice to actual builds.

---

## 📅 5 Jul 25

### 🐍 Automate The Boring Stuff With Python (ATBS)
- **Lesson 4 (YouTube) / Chapter 2 (eBook):** Focused on *Flow Control*.
- Practiced comparison and Boolean operators (`True` & `False`) using MacOS Terminal.
- Reviewed flowchart examples for `if/else/elif` and `while` loops — reminded me of similar exercises from Codédex.
- Had an idea to turn the *“She’s Too Young For You Bro”* flow logic into a mini game — something to explore later.
- Completed *Infinite Loop* exercise; confirmed `ctrl + C` stops the loop with a `KeyboardInterrupt` message.
- Modified “Who Are You?” infinite loop into a playful version called *“New pHone, Who Dis?”*
  - Observed infinite loop behavior when incorrect input was entered.
  - Noted a bug: The “access granted” message appeared even when input was incorrect — logic bug in `if` statement at the end. True/False condition needs refinement.
  - Program ends as expected when correct input is finally given — something to revisit during debugging practice.

> 🎯 **Note:** Will continue building familiarity with input validation, control flow logic, and testing user interaction via CLI.

 **📚 CodéDex**

**Detention Exercise** (Loops Module):  
- Practiced using `for` loops and `range()` functions.  
- Completed the exercise in two attempts. Double-checked solution due to how quickly it was completed.
- One of the shortest exercises so far (besides `print("hello world")`).

**99 Bottles Exercise** (Loops Module):  
- Used `for` loop, `range()`, and string interpolation.  
- Compared to the backend of email newsletters — same body, different personalized fields (e.g. name).  
- Initial output was backwards (0 up to 99). Attempted `{1 - i}` which resulted in output from 0 to -98.  
- Realized the proper `range()` was `(99, 0, -1)`. Will research more on how the 0 and sequence order work.
- Originally wrote the entire hook/chorus on one `print()` line. While it worked, the line-by-line solution was clearer and cleaner.

**✅ Up Next** 

**Fizz Buzz** is the final exercise in the Loops module.

- Remaining CodéDex Python modules are behind a paywall (`Join Club`).
- Considering pivoting to:
  - CodéDex’s *User Tutorial Projects* (mostly Python-focused),
  - Another beginner Python program/platform outside of CodéDex,
  - CodéDex’s *NumPy* (Intermediate, free) or *SQL* (Beginner) courses.
  - Exploring *Challenge Packs* in the *Practice* tab (includes Python, HTML, JavaScript).

> Not planning to stop using CodéDex anytime soon — just expanding the toolkit and seeking more advanced or varied challenges.

 23, 25 - 28 Apr 25 

.Continued AI Skills Fest, currently working on a module/challenge, that is apart of one of the AI modules provided by LinkedIn x Microsoft - AI for Organizational Leaders by Microsoft and LinkedIn ; Have been able to collect a few certificates to add on my page, on my LinkedIn profile.  
.Watched/rewatched ML videos to keep information fresh in mind. Mostly foundational info .
.2 courses left in module, then will take exam .
.Finished remaining courses, took exam, but failed (first attempt) . 


## 

22 Apr 25 

Finishing remaining part of Intro to GH (MSFT Learn) module. Upon getting to exercise, noticed it was the same exercise I already did upon GH tutorial (https://github.com/GroovyWoo/skills-intro-to-github-MML ) .
.However, I wasn’t able to complete this (the first time around) and found out why. There was an issue upon creating the first branch. Branch name wasn’t exactly the same, which was the reason for hold up in the process (reminder to self follow exact directions, and try not to add anything unless “outcome” is not affected. side note: I put 'my-first-branch-mml' instead of just 'my-first-branch' smh lol. Ended up deleting branch after pull request successfully merged and closed. Gives option to restore branch as well. 
	.After redoing the exercise, I learned/relearned about repositories, branches, commits and how to “officially” create pull requests, and merge a pull request from a branch (main and sub).

19 - 21 Apr 25 

Debating if I should continue to add to this particluar this Daily Log, or just create new md Daily Log upon each entry .

.Watched AI Isn't the Solution video by Teneika Askew. Breaking down difference between AI and Automation; Briefly broke down ML; Stream lining Workflow ;. 

.Reviewing GitHub tutorials & GitHub for Beginners (youtube playlist); Will need to familiarize myself with Licenses and GitIgnore files . 
.Currently doing Intro to GitHub via Microsoft Learn, not understanding pull requests same way as through youtube videos. Possible dated info that doesn't reflect on possible updated GitHub page. 
.Also learned how to create Discussions (via Intro to GitHub via Microsoft Learn Module), under a different repo; May need to create a 'Discussions' for this particular repo. Think that would help along the way. 

.Need to get back to the MSFT AI Skills Fest Challenges, but understanding GitHub along the way for future projects and documentation purposes will be benefical and essential ; In which a Branch was created for that particular part of the process/journey. 
.Still need to make a vlog for Youtube (and branding purposes). Maybe I'll create it before or after the Discussions feature is implemented.
